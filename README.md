# MercadoLibre's PHP SDK

This is the official PHP SDK for MercadoLibre's Platform.

## How do I install it?

       clone repository
       https://github.com/mercadolibre/php-sdk.git

## How do I use it?

The first thing to do is to instance a ```Meli``` class. You'll need to give a ```clientId``` and a ```clientSecret```. You can obtain both after creating your own application. For more information on this please read: [creating an application](http://developers.mercadolibre.com/application-manager/)

### Including the Lib
Include the lib meli in your project

```php
require '/MercadoLivre/meli.php';
```
Start the development!

### Create an instance of Meli class
Simple like this
```php
$meli = new Meli('1234', 'a secret');
```
With this instance you can start working on MercadoLibre's APIs.

There are some design considerations worth to mention.

1. This SDK is just a thin layer on top of an http client to handle all the OAuth WebServer flow for you.

2. There is JSON parsing. this SDK will include [json](http://php.net/manual/en/book.json.php) for internal usage.

3. This SDK will include [curl](http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php) for internal usage.

4. If you already have the access_token and the refresh_token you can pass in the constructor

```php
$meli = new Meli('1234', 'a secret', 'Access_Token', 'Refresh_Token');
```

## How do I redirect users to authorize my application?

This is a 2 step process.

First get the link to redirect the user. This is very easy! Just:

```php
$redirectUrl = $meli->getAuthUrl('http://somecallbackurl');
```

This will give you the url to redirect the user. You need to specify a callback url which will be the one that the user will redirected after a successfull authrization process.

Once the user is redirected to your callback url, you'll receive in the query string, a parameter named ```code```. You'll need this for the second part of the process.

```php
$user = $meli->authorize($_GET['code'], 'http://somecallbackurl');
```

This will get an ```access_token``` and a ```refresh_token``` (is case your application has the ```offline_access```) for your application and your user.

At this stage your are ready to make call to the API on behalf of the user.

#### Making GET calls

```php
$params = array('access_token' => $access_token);
$result = $meli->get('/users/me', $params);
```

#### Making POST calls

```php
$params = array('access_token' => $access_token);

  #this body will be converted into json for you
$body = array('foo' => 'bar', 'bar' => 'foo');

$response = $meli->post('/items', $body, $params);
```

#### Making PUT calls

```php
$params = array('access_token' => $access_token);

  #this body will be converted into json for you
$body = array('foo' => 'bar', 'bar' => 'foo');

$response = $meli->put('/items', $body, $params);
```

#### Making DELETE calls
```php
$params = array('access_token' => $access_token);
$response = $meli->delete('/questions/123', $params)
```

## I want to contribute!

That is great! Just fork the project in github. Create a topic branch, write some code, and add some tests for your new code.

Thanks for helping!
